**Definition:** A value that is considered false when evaluated in a Boolean context.

## First-Class Functions
**Definition:** A programming concept where functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

## For Loop
**Definition:** A control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly.

## Functional Programming
**Definition:** A programming paradigm focused on building software by composing pure functions and avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side effects.

## Generator Function
**Definition:** A function that can pause and resume its execution, returning an iterator object.

## Global Object
**Definition:** An object that contains global variables and functions, accessible from anywhere in the code.

## Higher-Order Function
**Definition:** A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result.

## Hoisting
**Definition:** The process by which variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation.

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
**Definition:** An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

## Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
**Definition:** A JavaScript design pattern that executes a function immediately after it's defined.

## Inheritance
**Definition:** A mechanism in which an object inherits properties and behaviors from another object.

## Iterable
**Definition:** An object that implements the iterable protocol, allowing it to be iterated over with `for...of` loops.

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
**Definition:** A lightweight data interchange format inspired by JavaScript object literal syntax.

## Lexical Scope
**Definition:** The scope determined by the location of variable declarations within the code.

## Literal
**Definition:** A notation for representing a fixed value in source code.

## Loose Equality Comparison
**Definition:** A comparison operator (`==`) that performs type conversion if the operands are not of the same type.

## Map
**Definition:** A data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each unique key maps to a specific value.

## Memoization
**Definition:** The process of caching the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

## Method
**Definition:** A function that is a property of an object.

## Module
**Definition:** A reusable piece of code that encapsulates related functionality and can be exported and imported between different JavaScript files.

## NaN (Not-a-Number)
**Definition:** A value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value resulting from an operation.

## Node.js

**Definition:** A primitive value representing the intentional absence of any object value.

## Number
**Definition:** A primitive wrapper object for representing numerical values.

## Object
**Definition:** A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value is any data type.

## Operator
**Definition:** A symbol used to perform an operation on one or more operands.

## Package
**Definition:** A directory containing a `package.json` file that describes a JavaScript module or library.

## Return Statement
**Definition:** A statement that ends the execution of a function and specifies the value to be returned by that function.

## Scope
**Definition:** The context in which variables are declared. JavaScript has function scope and block scope.

## Set
**Definition:** A data structure that stores unique values of any data type.

## Strict Equality Comparison
